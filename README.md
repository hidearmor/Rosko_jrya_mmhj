# Overview
This repository contains performance experiments of row-skipping outer product kernels (Rosko) for sparse-dense matrix multiplication (spMM) on CPUs. Rosko uses the CAKE tiling and scheduling algorithm for efficient multicore parallelism and minimal DRAM bandwidth usage. Rosko kernels are written using SIMD intrinsics. They outperform Intel and ARM Dense GEMM and spMM libraries for matrices with sparsities ranging from 72% to 99.9%. 

## Native Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vnatesh/Rosko.git
cd Rosko
make install
cd CAKE_on_CPU
source env.sh
sudo ldconfig $CAKE_HOME
cd ..
```

Installation automatically downloads and installs the following tool/dependency verions:

* `CAKE` 


## Docker Installation

We provide a dockerfile to initialize a docker container with pre-installed Intel oneAPI and Rosko libraries.

```bash
sudo docker build . -t rosko_image
sudo docker run --pid=host --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE -it rosko_image
```


## Quick Start

In the `examples` directory, you will find a simple script `rosko_sgemm_test.cpp` that performs CAKE matrix multiplication on a random sparse MxK matrix and a dense KxN matrix, given M, K, and N values as command line arguments. To compile the script, simple type `make`and run the script as shown below. Make sure you have sourced the `env.sh` file before running. 

```bash
~/Rosko/examples$ make
g++ -I/home/vnatesh/Rosko/include -I/usr/local/include/blis rosko_sgemm_test.cpp -L/home/vnatesh/Rosko -lcake -o rosko_sgemm_test

~/Rosko/examples$ ./rosko_sgemm_test 3 3 3
M = 3, K = 3, N = 3
0.546852	0.546852
-0.430778	-0.430778
-0.633527	-0.633527
-0.433842	-0.433842
0.640107	0.640107
0.383761	0.383761
-0.208048	-0.208048
-0.454641	-0.454641
1.107274	1.107274
CORRECT!
```

## Running Experiments:

Before running experiments, make sure the following additional dependencies are installed:

* `Intel`
	* `Vtune 2021.1.1` 
	* `OpenMP 4.5` 
	* `Linux perf 5.4.86` 

* `ARM` 
	* `ARMPL 21.1` 
	* `ARMCL 22.02` 
	* `OpenMP 4.5` 
	* `Linux perf 5.4.86` 

The experiments are organized in separate directories for each CPU architecture tested (Intel and ARM). Each arch-specific directory contains sub-directories corresponding to figures in the Rosko paper. To run an experiment and plot the associated figure, simply enter the directory and execute the `run.sh` file. An example to generate the load balance figure for the Intel CPU tested is shown below. Experiments should be performed in `sudo` mode to enable permissions for hardware profiling.

```bash
~/Rosko$ sudo -s
~/Rosko$ source env.sh
~/Rosko$ cd experiments/intel/load_balance
~/Rosko/experiments/intel/load_balance$ ./run.sh
```
